/*
* Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
*  Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
*  Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
*  Then print the name after striping the white spaces.*
